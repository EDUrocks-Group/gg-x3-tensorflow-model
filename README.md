An exact extraction of version 4.0.14 of the GoGuardian X3 Predictor TensorFlow model used for on device porn detection on devices with GoGuardian installed.

Though this model is really bad at its job, i really respect GoGuardian for not storing the screenshots they take of student devices & just processing it locally through an on device AI model.
